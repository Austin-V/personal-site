This site was inspired by http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/ and several of its derivatives. Though I'll likely use some tool like Astro in the near future, this is really what I like. The simplicity is hard to walk away from. A possible improvement to the current would be something like Jekyll, so I can preserve all written content in markdown form. Also, it already works with GitHub Pages.
